Bugs:
Some missing comparisons on Cell.
Missing type check on list literals, e.g. let foo=[1 horse]

Todo:
implement file regexps
make ls support regexps
implement date command
implement input type declarations for closures
implement env command
implement sum command
Add support for %<INTEGER> for offset based field identifiers
make file globing testable via fakes
Error source propagation
help
implement cmd command
implement format command for text formating
add and/or to filter command
add parens to filter command
Add missing pieces to csv command
add glob support to select command
Map cell types
Map literals
Map lookup
Only one job allowed in command substitution
Implement hashing for remaining cell types, e.g. closure
Implement if command if {true} `{} `{}
Implement loop command
Implement break/continue commands
Implement http command
Implement zip command to combine two streams
The bin command interprets files as a single binary blob.
The readline command reads interactive input from the user via the terminal
pbuf command that reads a protobuf message and deserializes it
avro command that reads avro files and deserialize them
fields and variables should support dot notation
add support for using namespace objects as actual namespaces
Start putting commands into namespaces
