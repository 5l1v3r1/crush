Bugs:
Some missing comparisons on Cell.
Variable subsitution happens too early in closures, leads to werid snafus.

Todo:
implement file regexps
make ls support regexps
implement date command
implement closures with named/typed arguments
implement env command
implement sum command
Add support for %<INTEGER> for offset based field identifiers
make file globing testable via fakes
Error source propagation
Error gathering thread that collects runtime errors
help
implement cmd command
implement format command for text formating
add and/or to filter command
add parens to filter command
Add missing pieces to csv command
add glob support to select command
Map cell types
Map literals
Map lookup
Only one job allowed in command substitution
Implement hashing for remaining cell types, e.g. closure
Implement if command if {true} `{} `{}
Implement for command for find / | each `{}
Implement loop command
Implement break/continue commands
Implement a function command to allow recursive functions, etc?
Implement http command
