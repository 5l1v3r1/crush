Add system tests for dealing with tables as streams
Make parse error reporting more helpful
Error source propagation
Add command-field to CrushError
Add source field to CrushError
Make error printing display source of error
Binary values can be big. Make them shared behind an Arc.
In closures without a signature, put unnamed variables in the variable 'unnamed'
Figure out how to make external commands with subcommands convenient again
Kwargs should maybe not be a dict? How should repeated arguments be handled? We should at least preserve order...
Len method to binary and table type
Comparison unimplemented for dict
Comparison unimplemented for struct
Allow empty closures
Missing some value serialisations and deserialisations
Allow while-loop without body
spawn_print_thread should not spawn new threads
empty_channel should not create new empty channels

Figure out how to make custom reduce commands
Data enums + pattern matching syntax
Add %% for recursive wildcard matches
Add readline command that reads one line of interactive text input from the user via the terminal
support adding prototypes to structs
New operators: += increment and friends
For single column tabular output, display it on screen it in many rows to save space
Arbitrary precision integers?
make file globing testable via fakes
Add package command to create a new namespace
Make names mandatory and unique for struct fields
Add support for %<INTEGER> for offset based field identifiers
Make it possible to use the pipe operator with the for command
pbuf.parse command that takes a protobuf definition and uses it to deserialize protobuf data
avro.parse command that deserializes avro data
toml.parse command that deserializes toml data
Add history command with all previous interactive invocations, including invocation string, current status, and misc metadata.
Add proc.jobs command
