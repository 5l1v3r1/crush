Sigils for a bunch of things:

# Variable substitution
echo ${foo}

# Regular expressions
ls r{^[0-9]{3,7}.txt$}

Because we want to be able to match wildcards and regular expressions against other things
than files, they are passed in as their respective type to the commands, and the command
will decide how to resolve different argument types.

# Lambdas
echo {pwd} # Passes in the output of the pwd command
echo `{pwd} # Passes in the lambda itself

Error handling:

Print errors on stderr.

Should maybe jobs hang around, and we can see their errors?

Environment variables:

#set variable foo to hold value bar
set foo=bar

# Set the variable list to contain a listing of all files on this system
set lst={find /}

# Set the variable re to point to a regular expression
set re=r{...}

Namespaces:

Should commands live in the same namespace as environment variables?

functions would simply be one more cell type.

# Create a function named some_function that's a wrapper around ls
set some_function=`{ls|sort key=modified}

Could be nice as we can pass in lambdas as arguments to e.g. the sort command. Pretty cool idea...

Unclear how we do argument handling to functions in this scenario.

Output of commands:

Is it in any way meaningful for commands/jobs to have an exit status?
